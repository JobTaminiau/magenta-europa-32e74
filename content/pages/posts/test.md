As part of my research projects, I often rely on Energy Plus to model building energy performance. Recently, I have started using Energy Plus in virtual environments. The code below shows how to install Energy Plus software on Google Colab.

      # install EP to "/usr/local/EnergyPlus-9-5-0"
      !chmod +x [shell file of Energy Plus install]
      !sudo [shell file of Energy Plus install]
